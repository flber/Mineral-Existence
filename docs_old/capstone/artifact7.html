				Trump used the full extent of his executive powers to derail climate change policy whenever possible, doing everything from refusing to listen to climate change scientists to defuding the E.P.A. and backing out of the Paris accords. His shocking disregard for public health is surely the most recent and worrying example of missuses of executive power, but he was also aided by the then, and currently, Republican Senate. Perhaps his worst action taken to prevent climate change mitigation was a reduction of environmental regulations which attempted to limit manufacturer's output of greenhouse gases, regulations which were created during the Obama era.
