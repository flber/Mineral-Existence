				More recently, big oil companies facing litigation at the state level have filed to have their suits brought to the federal court. Though the argument is currently only about whether or not these cases should be in the supreme court at all, it could result in interesting outcomes. One the one hand, if states can win a case against oil companies for climate change impacts at the federal level, it would set a precedent which would be effective at deterring climate-harming companies from doing too much damage. However, if the court decides that the suit has little basis, it could spell disaster for future litigation, especially at the federal level.
