				Recent reporting has revealed that almost twenty-four Democratic states joined to create a coalition to explore the possibility of using litigation to fight the Trump administration's efforts to degrade American climate change policy. Though the coalition has begun to lose momentum in light of Biden's win in the 2020 election, it reveals an interesting opportunity to push climate change action in case of push back from Republicans in Congress. The court system offers a way to improve climate change responses, though cannot act as an alternate route to pass legislation. While an actual laws would still need to be passed through congress, and thus through the Republican controlled Senate, arguing against currently weakened regulations in court could offer a way to overturn some of the damage made by the Trump administration.
