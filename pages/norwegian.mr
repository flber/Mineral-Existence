## Norwegian

Some notes while learning Norwegian
The "*" is to mark where an accent should be once I implement that in Pillar

### Notes

- "Du" (you) is used for the subject, as in "Du er Ben" (you are Ben)
- "Deg" (you) is used for the object, as in "a* treffe deg" (to meet you)
- forms of address aren't really used

### Lexicon

nice: hyggelig (HIGGehli)
to: a* (oh)
meet: treffe (TREHFFeh)
you deg (dye) / du 
too: ogsa* (OHsoh)
