<h3>My Plans for This Site</h3>
<p>It remains to be seen how this actually turns out, but my idea is that this will be a sort of news board on what I'm currently working on with this site specifically. I'll be using my feed script to add to it, and I suppose we'll just see how it goes!</p>
<h4>261020 - Variables, Metadata, and Restructuring</h4>
<p>While I currently have a pretty solid (if simple) site generator, it's missing a few tools and some extra customizability which I'd prefer it have. The main thing is that I currently have no way to store extra data about a file, like what sort of page it is, when it was last edited, what the title is, and so on. This is the most obvious problem, but is unfortunately not the most difficult. The main issue which I'm trying to solve right now is more of a design problem if anything, which is how I want to structure the building and rendering process of my site. Right now I just have a makefile which runs a rendering bash script which outputs html from markdown, plus a few extra substitutions of my own making (I'll probably write a full post on this process once I get the issue I'm talking about now nailed down). It works, but leaves little room for extra steps. While I could keep adding functionality to the render script (which I will do in a smaller capacity), larger substitutions such as a list of posts feel out of place in such a small script and would require a rewrite of how it works. This is due to my decision to leave the render script pretty dumb; it is given a single markdown file and outputs some edited html to be used by the makefile, and has no extra knowledge of the site as a whole.</p>
<p>My thinking as of right now is to have the makefile first run a script which generates a .meta file for file in the site, pulling variable from a header in each file. That script would also have the ability to return those values it collected. After the metadata is found (or updated), a second script would run to write those more complicated substitutions like post lists to the necessary .md files. Finally the render script would turn the markdown into html, and pass it back to the makefile for the completion of the build cycle. The idea of a lot of .meta files feels sort of gross though, so let me know if you have any suggestions.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think I might break from my bash-only system to include a bit of Rust, as I've been wanting to learn it for a while and I figure this won't be too challenging of an introduction to the language.
Anyway, let me know what you think, and maybe look out for another one of these updates soonish?</p>
