<h3>Now</h3>
<p>I'm currently working on a wave function collapse algorithm, which I also occasionally write articles about, but my most recent project has been this website. After first trying to start a blog with Jekyll I decided that I wanted something smaller, and, more importantly, something I can (easily) understand every part of. I ended up writing a little makefile to generate the html, and I'll be expanding it in the days to come.</p>
