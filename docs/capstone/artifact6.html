				Though it may seem odd, there is growing perspective in conservatives which supports climate change mitigation policy, based around an idea put by Russell Kirk as "Nothing is more conservative than conservation". Though the conservative idea of climate policy is far more incremental than what most Democrats want, there is opportunity for common ground. That is all the more important with current politics, and with a Republican-controlled Senate. Without common ground, and the agreement that climate change is a threat whether you are a conservative or a progressive, we will continue to be stuck in a battle fought out with legislation and filibusters.
				<br>
				The primary conservative idea of environmental policy emphasizes practicality (and frugality) as well as market-based solutions. This is, of course, very much at odds with the progressive hope for policy change to be fast and expansive. Additionally, conservatives are generally opposed to regulation on principle, but companies have proven time and time again to prioritize profit over sustainability and serious consequences may be the only way to break out of old habits. At the end of the day though, both sides know that there needs to be change, even if they disagree on the details. With so many details to work out though, and so little time, it remains to be seen if substantial change can be made, before it is too late.
