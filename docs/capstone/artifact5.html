				During the Trump administration, American progress on fighting climate change stagnated and then reversed. Trump's platform, bringing traditional jobs such as coal mining and car manufacturing back to America, was antithetical to any sort of progress, and his personal stance was in direct contradiction with the scientific community, perhaps largely to appeal t his primary supporters. Under these circumstances climate change litigation was impossible, and with the Senate having a republican majority that reality was even more harsh. 
				<br>
				Now with Biden going into office the future for American action against climate change is slightly more hopeful, though the legislative process still makes the dramatic change that Democrats have hoped for unlikely. Because any legislation passed has to go through the Republican-controlled senate, it must either be moderate enough for genuine Republican support, or so popular that they would almost have no choice. However, recent support from more than 40 big companies in the U.S., such as Amazon, Ford, and Citigroup,in a letter to Congress and Biden reveals that the push toward climate regulations may have more momentum than previously thought. Many of the companies mirrored Biden's ideas that leveraging American industry to enact environmentally conscious changes would not only help mitigate climate change, but also help the U.S. economy.
				<br>
				Though the legislative system often seems slow, unwieldy, and unmoving, significant backing and persuasive arguments could enable Biden and the Democrats to pass environmental legislation and reverse the damage which the previous administration dealt to global warming mitigation. Though swaying the Republican majority in the Senate may be quite challenging, increased awareness and support may prove to be what it takes to get legislation through.
