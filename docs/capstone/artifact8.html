				The hope that many have riding on Biden is simply a return to politics as normal. Despite of this low bar, however, Biden needs, and seemingly wants to, produce serious change in the current American climate change policy. Greatly reduced during the Trump administration, Biden now need to work twice as hard and leverage his executive powers to bring the U.S. back up to speed. Perhaps the quickest thing Biden can, and hopefully will, do is rejoin the Paris accords, an action which Biden could do as an executive decision without input from Congress. However, to enact actual change, and the promises which will undoubtedly be made in Paris, Biden needs to be able to bring both sides together on something the majority can agree with.
