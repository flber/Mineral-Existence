				A major change for climate change litigation occurred in 2018, when cities in Colorado filed lawsuits against Exxon Mobile and Suncor Energy, two massive oil companies. Previously a fight only happening on the coasts, such as in California and New York, the move inland signaled the growing fear of climate change, and our lack of action against it. The counties are suing the companies for their role in the increase in wildfires, droughts, and severe storms as a result of climate change. Additionally heartening to see is conservative groups also taking this course of action, as Republicans, often hesitant to make regulations, see litigation as a way of imposing the "free market" on big oil companies, forcing them to pay for their damages.
