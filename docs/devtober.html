<h3>Devtober!</h3>
<p>Wooo! It's October! Other than being one of my favorite months, I'm excited for October this year because I'm participating in a game jam called <a href="https://itch.io/jam/devtober-2019">[Devtober]</a>. It's a challenge to work on a game a bit every day for the month of October, and if you want to learn more (or participate in it) I'd reccommend checking out their page. Other responsibilities kicked my butt today, so I'm just going to write this overview of the idea and maybe a toot.</p>
<p>I'll be updating this page with dev-type news of my progress, as well as my mastodon account (with the hastag <code>#devtober</code>).</p>
<p>My basic idea is an open world multiplayer where the players never see each other, only the abstract stuctures they can create. I'll be mostly brainstorming that idea for the rest of this week, but for now I need to sleep!</p>
