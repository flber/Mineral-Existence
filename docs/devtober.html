<h3>Devtober!</h3>
<p>Wooo! It's October! Other than being one of my favorite months, I'm excited for October this year because I'm participating in a game jam called <a href="https://itch.io/jam/devtober-2019">[Devtober]</a>. It's a challenge to work on a game a bit every day for the month of October, and if you want to learn more (or participate in it) I'd reccommend checking out their page. Other responsibilities kicked my butt today, so I'm just going to write this overview of the idea and maybe a toot.</p>
<p>I'll be updating this page with dev-type news of my progress, as well as my mastodon account (with the hastag <code>#devtober</code>).</p>
<p>My basic idea is an open world multiplayer where the players never see each other, only the abstract stuctures they can create. I'll be mostly brainstorming that idea for the rest of this week, but for now I need to sleep!</p>
<h4>061020 Finally got the feed script working</h4>
<p>Welp, that took longer than expected. Finally figured out how to insert multiple lines with <code>sed</code> (I just ended up putting the user-inputted text into a text file, and then inserting that text nto the correct place of the target file). It's a bit jank, and I'd like to change how I'm getting user input (right now it's just <code>&lt;/dev/stdin</code>), but for now it'll do.</p>
<h4>021020 First update</h4>
<p>Spent most of today trying to implement a feed script to automatically add updates to a post quickly, but couldn't quite get it working. I don't have a ton of time for personal projects during the week (except for Wednesdays, which I always have free), so I think I'll be doing the actual gamedev on weekends, with weekdays reserved for planning. Hopefully I'll have some more interesting updates for all of you this weekend.</p>
