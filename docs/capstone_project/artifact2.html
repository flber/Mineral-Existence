				Founded in 1970 by President Nixon, the EPA's purpose is to guard public health and the environment by creating standards and environmental laws, provide grants to companies and institutions which want to teach about or protect the environment, and work with other countries to protect the global environment. Nixon created the E.P.A because of the need to address a growing environmental movement in the U.S., as well as an oil spill which took place shortly after he took office.
				<br>
				Arguably the two most important of the agency's initiatives are the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. These federal regulations govern all possible pollutants of water and air respectively, and as such have an incredibly wide-reaching scope. The Clean Air Act is especially interesting with regards to climate change, as it has been interpreted relatively recently as not just governing pollutants which harm people, but also greenhouse gases which harm the environment as a whole. In 2013 the EPA proposed carbon emission standards for future power plants and started the process to impose carbon emission standards on current power plants. 
				<br>
				The EPA is currently the most powerful force for climate change policy in the U.S. government, and remains as proof that a strong central government is the most effective for dealing with large scale regulation and crisis control. However, the EPA is still affected by other parts of the federal government, and during President trump's term its powers of climate change mitigation and education have been significantly hobbled. In 2017 the EPA was ordered to take down it web page on climate change, and they have also been forced to have their data undergo review from political appointees before being made public. Even more shockingly though is the rollback on environmental regulations during the Trump administration. As of October 15th, the presidency has revoked 72 environmental rules and regulations and has 27 more revocations in progress, a disturbingly and dishearteningly massive move backward in climate change policy.
