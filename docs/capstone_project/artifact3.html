				Perhaps the most influential figure in early U.S. conservationism, John Muir spent his life arguing for the protection of the American wilderness, laying the foundations of a movement which would later encompass not just efforts to conserve nature through national parks, but also through climate change policy. In October of 1890, Muir wrote a series of articles on western forests and wilderness which swayed public opinion on conservation so much that it pushed the Yosemite National Park bill to pass, arguably ushering in the first age of American conservationism. 
				<br>
				Throughout the 1890's Muir wrote articles espousing the virtue of nature and our responsibilities to protect it to pass on to future generations, articles which swayed public opinion so much so that Congress passed an act giving the president the power to create forest reserves and a national commission was formed to conserve existing reserves. These writings brought environmental issues to the forefront of the public for the first time, pushing federal legislation to be passed in support of the movement. Muir also became friends with President Theodore Roosevelt, and on a camping trip with the president in 1903 convinced him of the value of conservation. During Roosevelt's six years as president he created almost 150 million acres of forest reserves and doubled the number of national parks. 
				<br>
				Muir's influence on American conservationism is truly a testament to the federal government's ability to actually implement laws, regulations, and powers which respond to the desires of the American people, and the benefit of that ability.
