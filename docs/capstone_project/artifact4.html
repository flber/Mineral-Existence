				For a fantastic example of the "local" side of Federalism, one has to look no further than California's stance, and legislature, toward climate change. In the 1940's a chemist in California named Haagen-Smit discovered that smog from car exhaust was discoloring his garden, and by 1967 he was put made chairman of the new air resources board. When the E.P.A was created in 1970, California was allowed to continue to follow their own previously established air pollution laws. This independence has continued up to the present day, where California leads the country on emissions standards. 
				<br>
				More recently, the California Air Resources Board (C.A.R.B), headed by Mary D. Nicholas, an air-quality regulator, have been enforcing the single largest measure the U.S. has made to combat global warming: emissions standards on cars. With estimates showing that American's passenger cars produce more harmful emissions than the country's power plants, regulating their emissions is an important step. This state regulation is now directly in conflict with federal laws on emissions which were weakened under the Trump administration to appease car manufacturers. But with California, and the 12 states which follow California's standards, making up roughly one third of the American car market, car manufactures still have to comply with those stricter standards or face losing an enormous portion of their market.
				<br>
				This standoff between states and the federal government shows the power of the United States' system of federalism, which prevents any one group from controlling legislation and regulation. It is also important to note the influence state legislation can have on a federal level, as the Biden administration will likely use California's standards as a template for their own federal regulations. The interplay between the state and federal levels strengthens the United States as a whole, allowing groups to create laws that they view as important while ensuring some level of overall stability.
