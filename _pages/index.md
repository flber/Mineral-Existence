### Hello there

Thank you for visiting my humble virtual abode. This site is the third, and hopefully final, iteration of such a place, and will serve as a space for me to talk about my projects and thoughts, as well as a sort of memex in the form of the [{wiki}](wiki.html) page. It is inspired by [[Devine Lu Linvega's]](https://merveilles.town/@neauoire) [[XXIIVV]](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html), [[Josh's]](https://merveilles.town/@joshavanier) [[website]](https://avanier.now.sh/index.html), and  others, many from the [[Town of Merveilles]](https://merveilles.town/about) and the [[Webring]](https://webring.xxiivv.com/).

Here is what I'm working on [{now}](now.html).

And here are things I've written previously
