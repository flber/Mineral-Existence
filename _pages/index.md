### Hello there

Thank you for visiting my humble virtual abode. This site is the third, and hopefully final, iteration of such a place, and will serve as a place for me to talk about my projects and thoughts, as well as a sort of memex in the form of the [{wiki}](wiki.html) page. This place is inspired by Devine [[Lu Linvega's]](https://merveilles.town/@neauoire) [[XXIIVV]](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html),
