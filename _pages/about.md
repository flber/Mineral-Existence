### Hi! 
My name is Ben, and I'm an occasional game dev and enjoyer of roguelikes, currently learning Godot and working on a wave function collapse algorithm for texture generation (which I'm planning on talking about soon). Some of my favorite games (in no particular order) are:

- [[Dwarf Fortress]](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)
- [[Brogue]](https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/)
- [[Bad North]](https://www.badnorth.com/)
- [[Sunless seas]](https://www.failbettergames.com/sunless/)
- [[Noita]](https://noitagame.com/)
- [[TABG]](https://landfall.se/totally-accurate-battlegrounds)
- [[Streets of Rogue]](https://streetsofrogue.com/)
- [[Mandagon]](https://blindsky.itch.io/mandagon)

[[Here's]](https://github.com/flber/flber.github.io) the source code for this site
